# Demos to try out the GStreamer Pipelining, Compositing, and RTSP Server APIs

The goal is to recreate the combined presentation + camera view of the SMP using the GStreamer compositor,
and finding the right pipeline configurations.

The RTSPServer is a small demo of the GStreamer RTSPServer library, and uses the default GstRTSPMediaFactory
to build up a pipeline.
